                    <p>a. The job posted must exist in the Country advertised, unless it is a franchise opportunity (which must be stated in the description).</p>
                    <p>b. The job title should be specific and be the best description for the role. It must not include locations or salaries and should not be a slogan (e.g. Great Opportunity or Money To Be Made!).</p>
                    <p>c. Emails and URLs within job descriptions are not allowed. We will automatically remove these.</p>
                    <p>d. The description of the role should mention the required skills as well as details describing the role. Contact names should not be mentioned in the job description.</p>

                    <p>f. Advertisements which discriminate (or appear to discriminate) on grounds of sex, race, age or disability are illegal and may result in proceedings being taken against both the advertiser and the publisher. Advertisements are accepted by Jobs4Bahrainis on the basis that the advertiser confirms that any requirement or qualification which may appear to discriminate illegally is in compliance with any exemption available under the relevant legislation.

                    <p>g.
